# Pesapal-mini-ledger-rdbms
This project implements a minimal relational database management system (RDBMS) from scratch, which is demonstrated using a small Django backend. It shows a simplified transaction ledger similar to components used in payment processing systems. Focus is on clarity, correctness, and completeness.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to design and implement a simple RDBMS that supports:

- Table creation with basic data types
- CRUD operations
- Primary and unique keys
- Basic indexing
- Simple joins
- A SQL-like interface with an interactive REPL

Next, the database engine is  used by a Django web application to demonstrate real-world usage through CRUD operations.
